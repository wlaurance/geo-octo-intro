Possible Exam 1 Questions:
==========================

Prelude and Chapter 1 Cosmology ✔
---------------------------------
1. Define scientific method and then briefly describe the four steps
   employed in this method.
   The scientific method is an unbiased approach to finding answers
   through research, experimentation, and data interpolation.
   1. Formulation of a scientific problem or a question.
   2. Collecting data through experiments in the lab or field.
   3. Formating a hypothesis based on the results and data
      interpretation.
   4. Testing of the hypothesis.
2. Briefly explain the steps in the formation of our Solar System based
   on the Nebular Hypothesis.

 At first everything was way to hot. Then 100s later, temperature
decreased and sub atomic particles like electrons, neutrons and protons
formed. Hydrogen atoms formed after 5 hours. This is called a nebula gas
cloud. After some geological time, gravity pulled gas into spinning
balls and discs - the accretionary disk. Gravity pulled and pulled and
eventually the matter packed tightly and formed a hot glowing protostar.
**Boom!** fusion reactions began and stars are born.

 Applying this too our solar system, we first have some volatile
materials like H, He, CH4, C02, H20. Gravity started to pull and this
materials stuck together and formed planetesimals. With more collisions
inner heat developed. Heat developed layers because the of the
densities within the planetesimals. The sun makes solar wind which
stripped lighter elements from inner to outer. This is why inner planets
are more rocky.

3. We are all made of stardust. What does this mean? Describe the life
   cycle of stars (stellar nucleosynthesis) and how we can be made of
stardust.
4. How many “planets” are in our solar system? There are two kinds of
   planets – what are these and why are they so different? Pluto Is no
longer a planet – what is it?
 
 We have 8 planets in our solar system. Terrestrial planets are earth
like and gas-giant planets are gas and much larger that terrestrial
planets. They are different because when they were planetesimals, solar
winds from the sun pushed lighter (gasy) elements to the outer planets.
So closer to the sun are rockier planets, and further out are gasier
planets. Pluto is a Kuiper Belt object. It is no longer a planet because
its orbit that lies oblique to the plane of the soler system.

Chapter 2 What is the Earth Made Of? ✔
--------------------------------------
1. Today we approach the study of the Earth as a “systems science.” List
   the four systems. Describe or list what is included within each
system. Define and describe one “cycle”.
 * Hydrosphere - Surface water - lakes, rivers
   GroundWater = water in pores of rocks
   Water vapor in atomsphere.
 * Atmosphere - an evelope of gas consisting of nitrogen 78, and O 21.
 * Lithosphere = the earth is made of layers. Layers of the earth are
   the crust, mantle, and core.
 * Biosphere, living things on the earth, in the Hydroshere.
 * Cycles are interactions between different spheres. Water cycle.
   Precipitation, evaporation, transipration, vapour transport,
percolation, bodies of water.
2. The Earth’s interior can be divided into three major layers. Describe
   each layer by the following: average thickness OR depth to boundary
layers (use correct units); average density (use correct units); is it
solid, liquid or both; and composition (name the rock or dominant
elemental composition).
3. There are seven categories of earth materials; two of which, organic
   chemicals and volatiles, we will not be concentrating on. List and
briefly describe the other five categories of earth materials.
  * Minerals - solid substance in which atoms are arranged in an orderly
    pattern.
  * Glasses - A solid substance in which atoms are **not** arranged in
    an orderly pattern. Obsidian.
  * Rocks - Aggregates of mineral crystals or grains, and masses of
    natural glass.
  * Metals - Solid composed of metal atoms, (iron, copper, aluminum, tin
    etc).
  * Melts - Solid materials become hot and transform into liquid - magma
    and lava.

Chapter 3 Drifting Continents and Spreading Seas ✔
--------------------------------------------------
1. Alfred Wegener proposed the continental drift hypothesis. List and
   briefly describe the five pieces of evidence he used to support this
hypothesis.
  * The shapes of the continents match. The continents fit together like
    puzzles pieces that have drifted away over time.
  * Glacial deposits (till) and striated or scratch rocks. These rocks
    match up when the continents are put back together as puzzle peices.
    The southern rocks of Pangea form the southern ice cap.
  * Parts of Pangea straddled the equator. Coal swamps, salt deposits,
    and desert sands are scattered on the globe in higher altitudes. It
    is impossible that these things formed with the continents like they
    are today.
  * Land-based fossils. Same spieces of dinosaurs found on different
    continents today. It means that the different land masses were once
    connected.
  * Matching old rocks from old mountain belts. The Appalachian mountain
    range matches up with the mountains on the west coast of Africa.
2. Briefly describe Harry Hess’ hypothesis of sea-floor spreading. What
   was the proof that sea floor spreading does exist because it helped
scientists determine the rate of spreading.
  * Harry Hess' hypothesis claims that the sea floor forms at ridges so
    the oceans grow wider.
  * The old sea-floor sinks into the mantle at the trench.
  * Only the crust moved. Continents are passive riders. 
  * He had two pieces of evidence to support his theory.
    1. Magnetic anomalies
    2. Magnetic Reversals.
  * These helped geologists discover that the earth's magnetic field
    reversed polarity over geological time. With radiometric dating of
    lava flows, they could match the magnetic reversals with time.

Chapter 5 Minerals ✔
--------------------
1. Silicates are the major rock-forming minerals. List the five types of
   silicate minerals. Briefly describe each by telling how the how many
of the oxygens are linked in the Si-O tetrahedra and talk about the
relative resistance to weathering of each.
2. Minerals are classified by grouping them according to their chemical
   composition. There are seven mineral classifications. Choose five to
briefly describe or define.
   * Oxides - metal cation + oxygen anion Fe2O3
   * Sulfides - metal cation + sulfide anion PbS
   * Sulfates - metal cation + sulfate anion group, gypsum CaSO4
   * Halides - the anion is halgon ion SALT NaCl
   * Native Metals - pure masses of a singe metal (gold, silver etc).
   * Silicates, make up most minerals.
3. Minerals are distinguished from each other by their physical
   properties. There is a long list of physical properties. Choose five
to describe or define. 
   * Luster - is either metallic or non-metallic as the main two. Glassy
     and satiny, pearly, earthy.
   * Streak is when the mineral is crushed against an unglazed porcelain
     and the steak color is observed.
   * Hardness - is the resistance to scratching resistance of a
     mineral. MOHS hardes scale 1. Talc --> Glass 5.5 --> Diamond 10
   * Specific gravity is a ratio of the weight of a mineral divided by
     the the weight of an equal volume of water. It is how heavy it
     feels.
   * Crystal form is the degrees of crystal faces during development.
     Anhedral is no visible faces. Euhedral is well-developed crystal
     faces and **very** rare.
  
Chapter 12 Absolute and Relative Dating ✔
-----------------------------------------
1. Geologic principles allow us to interpret the sequence of geologic
   events or relative age. Name and describe five of the seven
principles.
   
2.  Define unconformity. Describe the three different types of
    unconformities. A picture of each type is required. 

Unconformity = mising geological time. Any break in the sedimentary
geologic record

Chapter 7 Sedimentary Rocks
---------------------------
1. Rocks at the surface of the Earth undergo physical and chemical
   weathering. Define physical and chemical weathering.  Describe two
examples of each type of weathering.
2. There are six factors which influence the formation of soils. List
   and describe five of them. 
3. Sedimentary structures help to reconstruct the depositional setting
   of sedimentary rocks. Describe four types of sedimentary structures
described in class and interpret how sediments were deposited for each
structure type (i.e. wind, water, flow velocity, flow direction….).  
4. List and describe the major steps in forming clastic/detrital
   sedimentary rocks.
