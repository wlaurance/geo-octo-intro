Possible Exam 1 Questions:
==========================

Prelude and Chapter 1 Cosmology
-------------------------------
1. Define scientific method and then briefly describe the four steps
   employed in this method.
2. Briefly explain the steps in the formation of our Solar System based
   on the Nebular Hypothesis.
3. We are all made of stardust. What does this mean? Describe the life
   cycle of stars (stellar nucleosynthesis) and how we can be made of
stardust.
4. How many “planets” are in our solar system? There are two kinds of
   planets – what are these and why are they so different? Pluto Is no
longer a planet – what is it?

Chapter 2 What is the Earth Made Of?
------------------------------------
1. Today we approach the study of the Earth as a “systems science.” List
   the four systems. Describe or list what is included within each
system. Define and describe one “cycle”.
2. The Earth’s interior can be divided into three major layers. Describe
   each layer by the following: average thickness OR depth to boundary
layers (use correct units); average density (use correct units); is it
solid, liquid or both; and composition (name the rock or dominant
elemental composition).
3. There are seven categories of earth materials; two of which, organic
   chemicals and volatiles, we will not be concentrating on. List and
briefly describe the other five categories of earth materials.

Chapter 3 Drifting Continents and Spreading Seas
------------------------------------------------
1. Alfred Wegener proposed the continental drift hypothesis. List and
   briefly describe the five pieces of evidence he used to support this
hypothesis.
2. Briefly describe Harry Hess’ hypothesis of sea-floor spreading. What
   was the proof that sea floor spreading does exist because it helped
scientists determine the rate of spreading.

Chapter 5 Minerals
------------------
1. Silicates are the major rock-forming minerals. List the five types of
   silicate minerals. Briefly describe each by telling how the how many
of the oxygens are linked in the Si-O tetrahedra and talk about the
relative resistance to weathering of each.
2. Minerals are classified by grouping them according to their chemical
   composition. There are seven mineral classifications. Choose five to
briefly describe or define.
3. Minerals are distinguished from each other by their physical
   properties. There is a long list of physical properties. Choose five
to describe or define. 

Chapter 12 Absolute and Relative Dating
---------------------------------------
1. Geologic principles allow us to interpret the sequence of geologic
   events or relative age. Name and describe five of the seven
principles.
2.  Define unconformity. Describe the three different types of
    unconformities. A picture of each type is required. 

Chapter 7 Sedimentary Rocks
---------------------------
1. Rocks at the surface of the Earth undergo physical and chemical
   weathering. Define physical and chemical weathering.  Describe two
examples of each type of weathering.
2. There are six factors which influence the formation of soils. List
   and describe five of them. 
3. Sedimentary structures help to reconstruct the depositional setting
   of sedimentary rocks. Describe four types of sedimentary structures
described in class and interpret how sediments were deposited for each
structure type (i.e. wind, water, flow velocity, flow direction….).  
4. List and describe the major steps in forming clastic/detrital
   sedimentary rocks.
