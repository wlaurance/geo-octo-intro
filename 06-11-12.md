Lava

### Products of Volcanic Eruptions

1. Lava Flows
   * Classification based on composition
     - Rhyolitic
     - Andesitic
     - Basaltic 
   * Viscosity
      Si ↑ Fe.Mg ↓ V up T down Gases up
      Cool lava high gas content highly visous
      blocky lava 
      chokes volcano ====> expolosive

      Si down Fe Mg up V down T up G down
      Hot lava not gassy not viscous

   Ash -> bowder sized
   Lapilli -> marble
   pyroclastic -> basketball to refrigerator size


### Gas and Vesicle formation
 Vesicles form in volcanic rocks
  * Highly visous lavas which have high gas content, sometimes release
    gases so quickly that pumice will form.
  * Low Viscosity lavas tend to be bubly and let gas escape gently.

 Will it blow or will it flow
  * Exposive eruptions
    1. High gas under pressure
    2. Gas expangs, cannot escape
    3. Clouds and avalanches of pyroclastic debris
    4. Lower temp, high viscosity
    5. Phreatonmagmatic -> have water.
  * Effusive eruptions


### HAZARDS
  * Lava flows - slow speed, most common hawaiian hazard.
  * Pyroclastic flows - avalance of rock material, hot ash and poisonous
    gas
  * Lahars -- Wet cement like slurry. 
  * Landslides - weaking of slopes from volcanic activity


## Types and shapes of Volcanos

  * Shield Volcano - Basaltic 9km
  * Stratovolcano/Composite - Viscous lavas 3km
  * Cinder Cone 300m


### Stratovolcano 
  * Mt. Rainier 


### CinderCone
  * Pu'uka Pele, Hawaii
  * Small in size
  * Steep slopes

## Where do find them

  * Host spots Ocean and continetn
  * Mid-Ocean Ridges
  * Convergent Boundaries
  * Continental Rifts

## Mantle
