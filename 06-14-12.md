# Standing on Shaky Ground

1. a new fault
2. slippage along an old fault
3. movement
4. explosion of volcano
5. giant landslide
6. mertorite impace
7. underground nuclear bomb tests

Stress builds up with friction and tension

### How does earthquake energy travel?

1. A break in rock
2. Seismic waves
3. Body Waves.

Siesmographs record the amplitudes of the body and surface waves.

Magnitude - measures the relative size of the largest shear wave.
Magnitude scales are logarithmic which  eans an increase of one unit of
magintude represents a tenfold(10X) increase in the maximum ground
motion

amplitude duration and damage increases in poorly supported substrates.


### Damage Landslides

Slippage occurs.
Layer is wet clay. Clay bond water.

All the clay slides.



# Plate Tectonics

Supporting evidence
1. Thickness of the Sediment
2. Age of Basalt 
3. Age of Ocean Basins
4. Ridges & Trenches in ocean basins
5. Something
6. Global Seismicity
7. North Face - Mt. Everest - We know that mountain ranges slowly rise
   over time.

## What is a tectonic plate?

Phycial classification

1. Diverging - boundaries seperating

2. Converging - boundaries coming together. Makes mountains.
  * Ocean - continent
  * Ocean - Ocean
  * Continental - Continental

  Concept of subduction

3. Transform boundaries
  No vertical movement. One plate moves left the other right. Strike
slip faults.

### Plate margins
1. Active margin - the plate boundary follow the continental margin ( ex
   Western north america or western south america.
2. Passive margin - is not a boundary. It includes the continental shelf
   which is thin continental crust.
