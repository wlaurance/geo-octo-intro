Igneous Rocks
=============
Igneous rocks make up all of the oceanic crust and much of the
continetntal crust. Most igneous rocks form from magma.
 * Intrusively from freezing crystallization of magma underground.
 * Extrusively from freezing of lava above ground.

Ingeous Intrusive Settings
--------------------------
Dikes - custs through layer
Sill  - includes itself in the layer.

After rocks dive deep enough into the earth they will melt.

Laccolith - Pool of lava
Batholist - Bigger laccolith
Plutons - Lava pit below volcano. The can take millions of years to
cool.


### How can magma form?
1. Decompression
   * Geotherm graph = shows pressure, depth and temperature.
   * High pressure prevents metling.
   * Decrease in pressure permits melting.
2. Melting due to addition of volatiles
   * Volatiles such as H20 and C0s mix with dry hot rock which breaks
     chemical bods to melt the rock.
   * A wet solidus means that volatiles have been added.
   * Thus the rock melts at lower temperatures.
3. Melting to the 

### Magma occurs in a range of compositions:
   * Felsic - 66% - 76% silica
   * Intermediate - 52% - 66% silica
   * Mafic  - 45% - 52% silica
   * Ultramafic   - 38% - 45% silica
### Magma Viscous?
   * Viscousity is resistance to flow. It depends of temperature,
     volitle componetns, and silica percentage.
### Classifying Igneous Rocks
   * Texture - glassy crystalline
   * Color
   * Grain Coarseness.
