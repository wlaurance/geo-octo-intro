# Textures

Metapmorhpic non-foliation or interlocking tectures

1. Recrystallization
   * The mineral stays the same, but the shape and size changes.
2. Phase Change 
   * Matter change ie liquid to solid, liquid to gas etc.
3. Neocrystallization
   * growth of new minerals different from the protolith.
4. Pressure solution
   * a rock is squeezed more strongly in one direction in the presence
     of water - mineral grains dissolve.
5. Plastic deformation
   * occurs at higher temps; some minerals can be squeezed and
     stretched.

## Causes of Metamorphism

What happens? Chemical bonds bend and stretch. If they break they can
move slightly and re-attach to other atoms.

Metamorphism occurs between 200C and 850C in the solid state.

Magma exists at temperatures of about 600C. Some rocks melt at higher
temperatures, why?

Differential stress - material is pulled or squeezed unequally from
different sides.

2 typers
normal-stree - push compression or pull tension perpendicular to a
surface.

Water can be produced from rocks through the metamorphism of muscovite
and quartz.

## Other metamorphic env

* *Burial* is a sedimentary basin
* *Dynamic* along faultlines
* *Shock* by metorites
* *Subduction zone* blueschist
