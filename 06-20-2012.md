======================
1. The hydrologic cycle

2. Stream characteristics

3. Streamflow dynamics

4. Streams and valleys
  Permenant stream
  Ephedural stream - only active during the wetseasons.


Drainage Networks
-----------------

Dendritic - uniform substrate

Radial - from a cone-shaped mountain. Volcano

Rectangular - along vertical joints.

Trellis - parallel valleys and ridges. Resistant ridge

Drainage Basin = Watershed

Rooted tree - Root - inner node - outer node.
First order basin Overland flow trajectories.

1. Outline drainage basins. Use higher elevations to find basins.

3. Stream flow dynamics
  * discharge and turbulent flow
    Discharge Q = VA  = velocity x area ft/sec x ft^2 = ft^3/sec cfc
    Q = wdv = width x depth x velocity "feild technique"
    
  * sediment load
    Bed load effected by elevation, rain fall, flash floods
  * longitudal profile of streams
  * base level

4. Streams do work - erosion
  * Base level = lowest elevation a stream is capable of eroding its
    channel. Affected by sea level and tectonic uplift.

  * Downcut - joints in hard rocks
  * Slump - Soft slump
  * slot canyon - weak layer
  * Grand canyon with cliffs.
  * Alluvium- filled valleys like the valleys in the coastal plain of VA 


5. Rapids - Different classes depending on how much rocks are sticking
   up.

6. Rivers - What is a knickpoint? Elevation changes in a river.
   different rock types effect knickpoints. 

  Meandering stream - needs high sediment load and low gradient.
  Over time there is erosion and cut banks form where the velocity of
water is at its highest. The cut banks will continue to erode.

7. Floods - Pours over into the flood plain.
  *  Flood crest - highest leve the steam reaches.
  *  flood
  *  floodplain flood - raised flat areas adjacent
  *  flash flood - during dam collapse or heavy rain
  
  * Recurrence Interval = (yrs of record + 1)/rank 
  * Houses must be built outside of the 100 year flood plain.
