# Exam 2 Possible Questions

## Chapter 6 Igneous Rocks

1. Define magma. Completely describe the three physical conditions
   needed to cause melting. Sketch a graph of the oceanic geotherm.
Label axes and describe and label all parts of the graph.

  **Magma** is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and
  solids found beneath the earth's surface. Magma forms better with 
   * decompression as pressure increases, melting point increases. Thus if
     super hot rocks quicky move up the sea level, they would become
  molten.
   * Melting due to the addition of volatiles. By adding H2O or CO2 mix
     with hot rocks breaks the chemical bonds and makes the rocks melt
  easier.
   * Melting due to heat transfer from rising magma. Heat transfer,
     radition occurs on a large scale underground.

2. There are four magma types. I talked about three most often in class.
   Discuss two of the magma types (not intermediate) by including
viscosity, temperature, dominant elements and resultant rocks of each.
  * Felsic - 66%-76% silica. Rhyolite, Granites. Tend to have more Na
    than Ca. High viscosity, with tendenancy to have very expolosive
eruptions. Lower temperature than mafic.
  * Mafic - 45% - 52% silica, basalts , Gabbro. Tend to have more Ca
    than Na. Less explosive because the viscosity is lower. Hawaii has
many mafic volcanoes. Higher temperature than felsic
3. The largest volume of igneous rocks can be found as intrusives in the
   Earth’s crust. List and describe/define the five intrusive igneous
  * Dike - Dike cuts across layers. Devils' Tower, Wyoming.
  * Sill - pushes between layers of rock and is confined in the layer.
  * Laccolith - Pool of lava and magma.
  * Batholist - Bigger laccolith
  * Plutons - Lava pit below volcano. The can take millions of years to
    cool.

bodies discussed in class.

4. Where are igneous rocks forming today? We discussed four settings
   where igneous activity occurs around the world. List and briefly
describe these settings. Give a specific example of each setting found
on Earth. 



## Chapter 9 Volcanoes 

1. Discuss the differences between composite (stratovolcanoes) and
   shield volcanoes. Be sure to include composition, relative viscosity
and temperature of lava, effusive vs. explosive release (gas content),
relative slope, height (relief) of each volcano and an example of where
in the world you would find each.
   * Sheild Volcano - The tallest volcanoes ~9km, small slope. Mt.
     Kilimanjaro and in Hawaii. Low viscosity (Mafic) lava. Higher temp.
Sheilds have a central caldera where lava flows from and flank eruptions
on its sides'. The new lava flow adds to the height. Typically a
basaltic flow. More effusive.
   * Stratovolcano - ~3km height, steep slope. Mt. Fuji, Mt. Vesuvius
     and Mt. Shasta. High viscosity (Falsic) lava. More of a andesitic
flow, rhyoltic dome or spire. Has crater in the center. Layers of
pyroclast, flank vents and domes on the sides. Sills and dikes, and lava
flows. Felsic to intermediate composition. More explosive

2. List and completely describe five volcanic hazards.
   * Lava Flows => streams of molten rock, slow in speed, intermediate
     to mafic composition. They add to the land as the flow.
   * Pyroclastic Flows => avalanche of rock material, hot ash and gas.
     up to 80km/h and 700C! Can incinerate, burn, and asphyxiate ppl.
   * Lahars => wet cement like slurry, formation requires
      1. An adequate water source
      2. Abundant unconsolidated debris
      3. Steep slopes at source
      4. Triggering mechanism.
   * Landslides => Volcanic activity weakens the land around them. The
     vibrations can trigger mass amounts of earth to fall down a
mountain slope.
   * Acid Rains - the volcanic gases form from SO2 and cause water
     contamination and plant damage. Wind can make the impact radius much
further.

3. Benjamin Franklin noticed that the summer of 1783 in France to be
   fairly cool and suspected volcanic “smoke” as the cause. Geologists
have studied glacial ice to understand the effect of volcanic activity
and climate.  How can a volcanic eruption create these cooling effects
on Earth?



## Chapter 11 Crustal Deformation and Mountain Building

1. There are five major kinds of folds. Describe each by the type of
   stress applied, shape, and where you can find each type on Earth. A
sketch of each is REQUIRED to answer this question and must include
labels of old and young rocks.

2. There are four types of faults – two of vertical and two of
   horizontal movement. Describe each by the type of stress applied and
where you can find each type on Earth. A sketch of each is REQUIRED to
answer this question.

3. Geologists have constructed the “life story” of the Appalachian
   Mountains of North America. Describe the life cycle of the
Appalachians by naming in order each orogenic event including time (in
years) of occurrence and briefly describe what forces were in play for
each event.



## Chapter 10 Earthquakes

1. Define earthquake. These terms are used in defining an earthquake as
   well - - define these terms: hypocenter, epicenter, types of seismic
waves used in finding the epicenter and magnitude.

2. List and describe five types of damage that result from a large
   earthquake.

3. Earthquake prediction is very hard to do. Seismologists have been
   working to understand the clues to imminent earthquakes on short-term
scales. There are four discussed in your book. List and describe these.



## Chapter 4 Plate Tectonics

1. There are seven pieces of evidence or observations you learned in
   class which supports the Plate Tectonics Theory. List and briefly
describe this evidence.

2. Define plate boundary. Describe the three different types of plate
   boundaries to include stresses applied, resultant faulting, foci
depths of earthquakes and an example of where the boundary is found on
Earth.
