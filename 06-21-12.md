Coasts
======

1. Landscapes beneath the sea
    Submarine canyons on both active and passive margins. They are old river
    channels on the continental shelf. 

2. Processes along coasts
    * Waves - wavelength, crest, trough, wave height. Wave orbitals -
      objects stay in one general spot if there are no other forces ie
      Currents. Wave base is where the fishes are. Wave base = wl/2
      1. Waves approaching shore - Wave length shortens, wave height
         increases. Speed decreases Waves crash over and break.
      2. Wave refraction - waves feel the bottom and the sides slow down
         first before the center of the wave. This causes headlands and
         enbayments ie erosions.
    * Currents - Rip currents occur when waves hit the shore dead on.
    * Tides - Intertidal zone. The moon's gravitational pull causes the
      tides. Note the tides !== waves.
      1. Intertidal zone - Tidal reach depends on the slope of the beach.
      2. Spring tide - the sun and the moon gravity match up
      3. Neap tide - the sun and the moon are perpindicular and the there
         exists a solor tide and a lunar tide.

3. Coastal Landforms
  * uplifted terrace. Cliffs of dover.
  * Cobble/pebble beach
  * sandy beach
  * mountain beaches
  * undercutting of a cliff.
  * Wave-cut bench
  * Sea arch
  * Saltmarsh
  * Fjord - where a glacier used to be and filled with water.
  * coral reef
