Sedimentary Rocks
=================

Background - Raw materials, clastic sediments ( mineral, rocks ) +
cementing materials ( from water, like quartz )

* gravel ------- larger than 2mm
* sand   ------- sand-sized
* silt and clay- fine-grained

What is a Rock? 

* *Minerals or other rock pieces*
* Glass
* Shells
* Organic particles


Clastic process:
----------------

Weather or erode existing rocks.
Joints - cracks in rocks.
Fault - cracks in rocks with movement.

A lot of material on the continental crust is granite.

1. Physical Weathering-Root and Salt Wedging
2. Spheroidal Weathering-Rounding of edges, type of chemical weathering.

Weathering rate depends on rock structure, number of joints, rock size, climate


### Moving the Pieces

How can you move sediments of all sizes?
* Wind
* Water
* Ice
* Gravity

Grain size will decrease the further rocks move.
More angular, closer to source.
Minerals vary less as transport length increases.

Sorting 


### Deposition

Deposition environment
Sedimentary structures

* Geographic setting where sediment is accumulating
* Determines the nature of the sediments that accumulate( grain size,
  grain shape etc).

Primary bedding vs. Internal layering

Transport direction from crossbeds

Sand dunes

Graded Bedding.

Sedimentary Structures

* Ripple Marks

### Lithification

1. Compaction
   * Sediments accumulate
   * weight
2. Cementation
   * Precipitation of other minerals into spaces.


The Biochemical (bioclastic) Process
====================================

Shells of marine organism made of calcite, aragonite, silica and settle
to the bottom of water. Buried with time and lithified into rock from
percolating groundwater.

Examples are fossil limestone, chalk, coquina and chert.

### Soil

How is it formed? Sediments, precipitation, microbes and plants.

Types of soils. We have pedalfer in Williamsburg, VA

Substrate Composition

1. Climate
2. Substrate Composition
3. Slope Steepness
4. Drainage
5. Time
6. Vegetation Type
