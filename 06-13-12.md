Deformation and Mountain Building
=================================

1. Mountain belts

Mt. Everest - Himalayas

### Orogeny
  * a mountain building-event
  * tens of millions of years
  * Erosion will eventually bevel the mountains down to sea level. Will
    take at least as long as creating them.


2. Deformation
   * Types - ductile and brittle
   * Causes - force and stress
   * More types - faults and joints

Undeformed beds = Badlands, SD

Whats happening on the chemical level?
* Brittle deformation - chemical bonds snap
* Ductile deformation  - chemical bonds stretch and bend. Form new minearls.

Temperature, pressure, deformation rate, and rock composition affect
deformation.

Pressure - all around like being underwater
Compression - pushing from two perpendicular directions
Tension - 
Shearing -

### Joints vs. faults
Joints = natural cracks that form in brittle rocks in response to
tensional stress; no movement along a joint
Faults - fractures in a way...


#### Faults
Strike-Skip - Right Lateral > Horizontal (map view)
Normal - Head block falls down ( with gravity sort a) Tensional - Basin
and Range mountain building, not as tall.
Reverse - Head block moves up ( Compressionial - Mtn Building ) Also
called thrust fault.

#### Folds
Anticline-Axial Plane, hinge line \cap
Syncline-  Axial plane, Hinge line \cup
Monocline- Two hingles ===

### How to build Mountains

Incoming exotic terrane, Active accretionary prism. Active arc Older
acreeted terrane, suture, extinct arc, fold-thrust belt.

Typically think of convergent margin orogen.
